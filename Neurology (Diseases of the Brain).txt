What Is Dementia?
Dementia is a general term for loss of memory, language, problem-solving and other
thinking abilities that are severe enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer's is the most
common cause of dementia.

About dementia
Dementia is not a single disease. It's an overall term to describe a collection of symptoms
that one may experience if they are living with a variety of diseases, including Alzheimer's
disease. Diseases grouped under the general term "dementia" are caused by abnormal
brain changes. Dementia symptoms trigger a decline in thinking skills, also known as
cognitive abilities, severe enough to impair daily life and independent function. They also
affect behavior, feelings and relationships.
Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60-80% of cases. Vascular dementia, which occurs
because of microscopic bleeding and blood vessel blockage in the brain, is the second
most common cause of dementia. Those who experience the brain changes of multiple
types of dementia simultaneously have mixed dementia. There are many other conditions

Symptoms and signs of cognitive impairment and dementia
An early stage of memory loss or other cognitive ability loss is called mild cognitive
impairment (MCI). Signs of MCI, which can progress to dementia, can vary greatly.
Examples include problems with:
Short-term memory.
Keeping track of a purse or wallet.
Paying bills.
Planning and preparing meals.
Remembering appointments.
Traveling out of the neighborhood.

Causes
Dementia is caused by a variety of diseases that cause damage to brain cells. This damage
interferes with the ability of brain cells to communicate with each other. When brain cells
cannot communicate normally, thinking, behavior and feelings can be affected.
The brain has many distinct regions, each of which is responsible for different functions
(for example, memory, judgment and movement). When cells in a particular region are
damaged, that region cannot carry out its functions normally.

While most changes in the brain that cause dementia are permanent and worsen over
time, thinking and memory problems caused by the following conditions may improve
when the condition is treated or addressed:
Depression.
Medication side effects.
Excess use of alcohol.
Thyroid problems.
Vitamin deficiencies.
Diagnosis of dementia
There is no one test to determine if someone has dementia. Doctors diagnose Alzheimer's
and other types of dementia based on a careful medical history, a physical examination,
laboratory tests, and the characteristic changes in thinking, day-to-day function and
behavior associated with each type. Doctors can determine that a person has dementia
with a high level of certainty. But it's harder to determine the exact type of dementia
because the symptoms and brain changes of different dementias can overlap. In some
cases, a doctor may diagnose "dementia" and not specify a type. If this occurs, it may be
necessary to see a specialist such as a neurologist, psychiatrist, psychologist or
geriatrician.

Dementia treatment and care
Treatment of dementia depends on its cause. In the case of most progressive dementias,
including Alzheimer's disease, there is no cure, but three treatments — donanemab
(Kisunala™) and lecanemab (Leqembi®) — demonstrate that removing beta-amyloid, one
of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, from the brain reduces cognitive and functional
decline in people living with early Alzheimer’s. Others can temporarily slow the worsening
of dementia symptoms and improve quality of life for those living with Alzheimer's and
their caregivers. The same medications used to treat Alzheimer's are among the drugs
sometimes prescribed to help with symptoms of other types of dementias. Non-drug
therapies can also alleviate some symptoms of dementia.
Ultimately, the path to effective new treatments for dementia is through increased
research funding and increased participation in clinical studies. Right now, volunteers are

New research shows there are things we can do to reduce the risk of mild cognitive
impairment and dementia.
Read Dr. Carrillo's Blog
Some risk factors for dementia, such as age and genetics, cannot be changed. But
researchers continue to explore the impact of other risk factors on brain health and
prevention of dementia.
Research reported at the 2019 Alzheimer’s Association International Conference®
suggests that adopting multiple healthy lifestyle choices, including healthy diet, not
smoking, regular exercise and cognitive stimulation, may decrease the risk of cognitive
decline and dementia.

theinformationmaynotbereliable.
Thefactthattheprevalenceofdepressionandanxietyamongneurologypatientsis
very high suggests shared pathophysiological processes. The etiology of depression in
neurologicaldiseasesislikelymultifactorialandhasbeenattributedtovariousmechanisms
includingalteredsignalingofneurotransmitters,changesinbrainstructure,inflammation,
disruptedneurotrophicfactors,andpsychosocialagents[5]. Arecentstudyshowedthat
there is a shared genetic basis between AD and depression [20]. In some neurological
disorders,suchasAD,epilepsy,andstroke,theevidenceindicatesthatthereisabidirectional
relationshipbetweenthesetwoconditions[5,21]. Thus,depressionmustbeconsidereda
risk factor for certain neurological disorders, and vice versa. However, past episodes of
depressionorpre-existingdepressionareassociatedwithanincreasedriskofdepressionin
patientswithvasculardementia,AD,PD,andstroke[22–26].Thereisarelationshipbetween
thedegreeofcognitivedeclineanddepressivesymptomsovertime,suggestingastrong

Additionally,inpatientswithPDotheridentifiedriskfactorsofdepressionincludefemale

However,otherstudieshaveshownthatanxiety,butnotpost-strokedepression(PSD),had

3. OverviewofDepressioninAlzheimer’sDisease
NeuropsychiatricsymptomsaffectnearlyallpatientswithAD.Specificallyfordepres-
sion, a recent meta-analysis showed that its prevalence in patients with mild cognitive
impairmentwas25%ifderivedfromcommunity-basedsamples,and40%fromclinic-based
samples[39]. Ameta-analysisoftheprevalenceofmajordepressivedisordersamongolder
adultswithdementiaofdifferentorigins(all-causedementia),foundthatitsprevalencein
patientswithADwas14.8%,andhigher(24.7%)inpatientswithvasculardementia[40]. In
additiontoAD,depressionisalsohighlyprevalentinotherdementias,suchasLewybody
dementia[41],frontotemporaldementia[42],andHuntingtondisease[43,44]. Ifstudied
attending to the dementia stage, a recent meta-analysis showed that, despite a lack of
consensusonthebestdiagnosticstrategy,theprogressionofADisassociatedwithmore
severeapathyandlessseveredepressionandanxiety. Nonetheless,thehighprevalenceof
affectivesymptomsacrossdementiastagesindicatesthataffectivedisordersmayinteract
witheachotherandinterferewithwell-beingfromtheearlieststagesofthedisease[45].
TheNationalInstituteofMentalHealth(NIMH)criteriaof2002havebeenthestandard

treatmentselection. Morestudiesarerequiredtoimprovethequalityoftheevidencethat
substantiatestheitemsincludedinthecriteria.[47].
Aswithallneurologicaldiseases,astructuredclinicalinterviewisessentialduringthe
diagnosisofdepressioninAD.Thiscanbehelpedbypublishedinstrumentsandscales
specifictopatientswithAD,buttheirtruevalidityremainsuncertain[8]. Recently, the
Eight-itemInformantInterviewtoDifferentiateAgingandDementia(AD8®)wasfoundto
havehighsensitivityintheidentificationofadultswhomaybenefitfromfurtherspecialist
assessment,inavarietyofsettings[48].TheCornellScaleforDiagnosisofDementia(CSDD)

Based on the available literature, a two-step approach may be considered. First,
the initial diagnosis should be based on a structured interview following the different

thisfirststep,theuseoftheAD8®isusefultohelpdiscriminatebetweensignsofnormal

of impulse control disorders [55,56]. However, it is commonly accepted that affective
disorders,suchasdepressioninPDareunder-recognizedandundertreated[9,57],possibly
because some symptoms of depression may be attributed to PD. A systematic review
foundthatclinicallysignificantdepressivesymptomscouldbepresentinupto35%of

BrainSci.2023,13,318 5of16
PDpatients,withmajordepressivedisorder(MDD)affecting17%ofPDpatients,minor

depressionin70%ofPDpatientswithoutdementia,anxietyin69%,andapathyin48%[51].
Additionally,theseneuropsychiatricsymptoms,whichareassociatedwithlongerduration
andhigherseverityofthedisease,couldbeexhibitedpredominantlyindifferentclusters
ofpatients[51]. Depressivesymptomsoftencorrelatewithanxietydisorders,cognitive
impairment,andpsychosis[59].
ThesymptomsofdepressioninpatientswithPDoftenincludeapathy,psychomotor
retardation,memoryimpairment,pessimism,irrationality,andsuicidalideationwithout
suicidalbehavior[60,61]. AstudyofdepressionsymptomsinpatientswithPDfoundthat

reviewofdepressionratingscalesinPD,theclinician-ratedandwidelyusedHamilton
DepressionRatingScale(HAMD-17),andtheself-reportGDS-15wererecommendedfor
screeningandmeasuringtheseverityofdepressioninPD[68]. Again,theGDS-15maybe
apreferredchoiceduetoitsbrevityandeaseofusedesignforolderadults,buttheauthors
considered other scales as valid and reliable instruments to use in PD, including self-
ratedscalessuchastheHospitalAnxietyandDepressionScale(HADS-D),theHamilton
DepressionInventory(HDI),theBeckDepressionInventory(BDI),andalsotheobserver-
report Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). It is worth noting that

5. OverviewofDepressioninStroke
As is the case in AD or PD, depression is the most frequent affective disorder after a
stroke and has a major impact on post-stroke rehabilitation, quality of life, mortality, and
disability[22,70].SystematicreviewshaveshownthatPSDcanoccurinapproximately1in3
patientswithastroke[71,72].Thisprevalenceremainsstableupto10yearsafterthestroke[22].
TheetiologyofPSDiscomplexandlargelyunknown. Multiplefactorsandmecha-
nisms(biologicalandpsychological)couldcontributetoPSD[73]. Earlyhypotheseson
the etiology of PSD pointed to pre-existing micro- or macrovascular cerebral lesions as
the underlying cause of the disease in stroke patients [74]. In this view, some of these

BrainSci.2023,13,318 6of16
cardiovascular lesions could have been present before the stroke developed. However,
amongvascularriskfactors,onlyhypertensioncanpredictPSD,whileotherfactors,such
as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and smoking, were not independentpredictorsof
PSD [75]. Alternative hypotheses supported by more recent studies points to changes
inneurotransmitterbalances,inflammatoryprocesses,neuralnetworkdisfunctions,the
rolesofhomocysteineorvitaminD,orsocialpsychologicalaspects[73,76–78]. Todate,no
definiteassociationbetweenlesionlocationandPSDhasbeenfound[79,80]. Somestudies
havepointedtofrontalcorticalandsubcorticalstructuresplayingaroleinPSD,butmore
studiesareneeded[78].
There are no clearly defined specific symptoms of depression in patients with a
stroke. Researchsuggeststhattheevaluationofdepressionintheacutephaseofstrokeis
critical[70]. AffectivesymptomsdescribedinPSDincludedecreasedemotionalreactiv-
ity,anhedonia,andsocialwithdrawal. Somaticsymptomsincludefatigue,constipation,
anorexia,sleep–wakerhythmdisorders,anddecreasedlibido,whilecognitivecomplaints
areaccompaniedbydifficultyconcentrating,feelingsofhopelessness,guilt,andworth-
lessnessandhallucinations[81]. PatientswithearlyPSDhavemoresomaticsymptoms,
whereaspatientswithlatePSDhavemorepsychologicalsymptoms. Astudyofpatients
with first-ever ischemic strokes found that patients often reported crying and sadness,
ratherthanapathy,uponadmissionintothestrokeunit. Inthesepatientscryingsoonafter
thestroke, age< 68years, andseveredisability werepredictors ofPSDwithinthefirst
yearofthestroke[82]. ThereareoverlappingsymptomsofPSDandstrokes,whichmakes
diagnosismorechallengingandcouldleadtooverdiagnosis. However,thepresenceof
somestrokesymptoms,suchasaphasiaoragnosia,andcognitiveimpairment,maynot
allowthecorrectevaluationofPSDandleadtounderdiagnosis.
PreventionofPSDshouldbefocusedontheidentificationofhigh-riskpatientsfor
PSD, and consider possible adverse events associated with SSRI therapy, such as bone
fractures(RR2.28)andnausea(RR2.05)[83]. ThecomplexityofPSDmechanismsmakes
itspreventionandtreatmentchallenging. Depressionafterstrokerequirescloseclinical
follow-up,especiallythosepatientsatthehighestrisk,andtreatmentsshouldengageall
thehealthcareprofessionalsinvolvedinthetreatmentofstrokepatients[84].
An efficient way to detect PSD is the subsequent administration of the 9-Item and
2-ItemPatientHealthQuestionnaire(PHQ-9,PHQ-2)[16]. TheuseofPHQaimstoearly
detectPSDasanessentialfirststepforoptimizingboththerapeuticmanagementofde-
pression,andrecoveryofpost-strokesequelaeatmultiplelevels. Aprospectivestudyof
171 consecutive patients with stroke measured depression in the 6th to 8th weeks after
stroke using the PHQ-9 and PHQ-2 and Composite International Diagnostic Interview.
Screening of depression was best achieved with a PHQ-9 score ≥ 10 and a PHQ-2 ≥ 2.
Interestingly,intheclinicalsetting,administeringthePHQ-9onlytopatientswhoscored
≥2onthePHQ-2improvedtheaccuracyofscreeningdepression[16].

andStroke
6.1. CommonTherapeuticApproaches

In terms of evidence-based therapeutic approaches, there is still a need for well-

studiesarehighlyheterogeneousintermsofinclusion/exclusioncriteriaforthepatients
(e.g.,mixedminorandmajordepressionpopulations),diagnostictechniques(e.g.,clinical,
scales), methodology (e.g., statistical methods), sample size, and the time of diagnosis
of depression with respect to the neurological disease. A large placebo effect has been
observedinmanyrandomizedstudiesofantidepressantsinPD[85,86]. Thisheterogeneity
oftenpreventsdrawingrobustorgeneralconclusions.
For the treatment of MDD, pharmacological treatment is central, but there are no
specific guidelines for the election of the antidepressant to use in specific neurological
diseases(AD,PD,PSD).Therelativeefficacyandacceptabilityofcommonantidepressants
usedinclinicalpracticewererecentlyreviewedinameta-analysis[87].
6.2. UseofSSRIs,SNRIs,andMultimodalAntidepressantDrugs
SSRIsandSNRIshavebeenusedformanyyearsinthetreatmentofdepressionand
remainthefirstlineoftreatmentfordepressionsecondarytoneurologicconditions[8,57,88].
Theiruseispreferredoverotheragentsduetotheirrelativelyfavorablesafetyprofileand
ease of administration. However, the use of pure SSRIs has been associated with the
presenceofapathy[89]andemotionalbluntingindiseaseswherethereisanadditional

situations,suchasinPD,andinelderlypopulations,theuseofSNRIshasbeenseento

Despite some studies claiming that the use of SSRI for depression in AD has no
clear significant effects [92], the limited evidence for supporting the generalized use of
antidepressantsindementia[93]ishighlyattributabletomethodologicalissuesandthe
fewrandomizedclinicaltrialsperformedtodate,whichlimitstheclearconclusionsoftheir
potentialrole[94]. Consideringalltheselimitations,placebo-controlledstudiesinrecent
yearshaveevidencedtheefficacyofescitalopramandsertralineforimprovingdepression

In PD, SSRIs and SNRIs are also considered first-line pharmacological treatment,
althoughtheevidenceofefficacyisalsoweak[86,99–101]. AstudyfoundthatSSRIswere
associatedwithgreaterapathyinpatientswithPD,whiletheuseofSNRIswasassociated
withlessapathy[102]. Inrecentrandomizedcontrolledtrials,citalopramandvenlafaxine
haveprovenefficacyinPDdepression,aswellastricyclicantidepressants(TCA),especially
nortryptiline(10–50mg/day),whereastheevidenceforparoxetineisconflicting. Published
meta-analyses of antidepressants in PD have found a higher efficacy for nortryptiline
anddesipramineoverSSRIsandSNRIs. However,TCAsneedtobeusedcautiouslyin
PD considering their anticholinergic effects and potential cardiotoxicity and should be
avoidedinpatientswithcardiacproblemsandorthostatichypotension. InPDpatients
withdementia,TCAmayproduceconfusionanddelirium[9,86,101,103].
Inpatientswithstroke,SSRIsarealsousuallyfirstchoice,astheiruseisassociatedwith

There is an urgent need, however, for the development and adequate testing of
newpharmacotherapiesforpatientswithneurologicaldiseases. Intheseconditions,the
antidepressantofchoicewouldbeexpectedtopreserveorevenimprovecognitivefunctions,
and to have an additional impact on functionally impacting symptoms such as sleep,
mobility,andfatigue[109].
In the past decade, pharmacological research has focused on the development of
new agents for the treatment of not only depressive symptoms, but also cognitive and
functionalones,leadingtothedevelopmentofmultimodalantidepressants. Vortioxetine
is a recently developed antidepressant with a new mechanism of action that combines
inhibitionoftheserotonin(5-HT)transporterandastrongaffinityforseveral5-HTrecep-
tors [110–113]. Vortioxetine acts as an antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT3, 5-HT1D, and
5-HT7receptors,asapartialagonistat5-HT1Breceptors,andasafullagonistof5-HT1A
receptors[111]. Theresultoftheseeffectsistheenhancementofserotonin,noradrenalin,
dopamine,acetylcholine,andhistaminelevelsinspecificareasofthebrain[114]. Onthe
basisofaseriesoflargeclinicaltrials[115],vortioxetinewasapprovedin2013bytheUS
Food and Drugs Administration for the treatment of MDD [116] and by the European
MedicinesAgencyforthetreatmentofmajordepressiveepisodes[117]. Currentguidelines
includevortioxetineamongfirst-linetreatmentsforMDDinsomecountries[118]. Ina
meta-analysis (17 studies, N = 3653) reviewing the cognitive effects of antidepressants
basedonneuropsychologicaltests,vortioxetinehadthelargesteffectsonprocessingspeed,

tivelyimprovedemotionalblunting,overallfunctioning,motivationandenergy,cognitive
performance,anddepressivesymptomsinpatientswithMDDwithpartialresponseto
SSRI/SNRI therapy and emotional blunting [123]. Another recent randomized clinical
trialcomparingvortioxetinewithothercommonantidepressants(escitalopram,paroxetine,
bupropion,venlafaxine,andsertraline)foundthatvortioxetineimprovedcognition(execu-
tivefunctions,selectiveandsustainedattention,short-termmemory,recallandnonverbal
reasoningability)andmoodinelderlyADpatientswithdepressivesymptoms,compared
with all the other antidepressants, and was safe and well tolerated [124]. There is also

studies,someofthesymptomscharacteristicofPD,suchasapathy,cognitivefunctionand

andnoseveresideeffectswereobserved. Similarly,vortioxetinemightplayanimportant
role in the treatment of depression in stroke survivors, because of its effects in improv-

However,reportedstudiesareverysmall,andavailabledataarepreliminary,soitmust

7. Non-PharmacologicalTreatmentofDepressioninMajorNeurodegenerative
DiseasesandStroke

patients.Forexample,physicalactivityandaerobicexercisemaybeeffectiveinthemanage-

8. Conclusions
Depressionisafrequentaffectivedisorderacrossneurologicaldisorders,andisoften
a determinant of the burden of the disease, quality of life, and mortality. Although in
the treatment of depression, a multidisciplinary approach is optimal, the neurologist
shouldrecognizesymptoms,carryonadiagnosis,andstarttherapyasearlyaspossible.
Thereshouldbeanincreasedawarenessoflesser-knownsymptomsofdepression,suchas

Novel treatments are emerging for the treatment of depression in the context of
neurologicaldisorders. Althoughtheefficacyofantidepressantsiswellconsolidatedfor
major depressive disorder, evidence for their role in milder forms of depression often
associatedwithAD,PD,orstrokesisweaker. Inthisregard,itisessentialthatrandomized

Abstract
Neurodegenerative disorders are primarily characterized by neuron loss. The most common
neurodegenerative disorders include Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. Although there are
several medicines currently approved for managing neurodegenerative disorders, a large majority
of them only help with associated symptoms. This lack of pathogenesis-targeting therapies is
primarily due to the restrictive effects of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), which keeps close to 99%
of all “foreign substances” out of the brain. Since their discovery, nanoparticles have been
successfully used for targeted delivery into many organs, including the brain. This review brie ly
describes the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, and their current management approaches. We then highlight the major challenges of
brain-drug delivery, followed by the role of nanotherapeutics for the diagnosis and treatment of
various neurological disorders.

1. Introduction
Neurodegeneration has been identi ied as the pivotal pathophysiological change in most brain-
related disorders [1]. Regardless of the incessant efforts by modern science to create a medical or
surgical solution, the outcome has not been favorable. Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) such as
Alzheimer’s and dementia continue to be a clinical concern in most older people [2,3]. The highly
effective blood–brain barrier (BBB) continues to be a real barrier towards the successful
management of NDs. Despite the several successes that have been demonstrated with surgeries and
highly evasive techniques, their clinical acceptance is limited due to varying concerns about their
long-term bene it, owing to the potential damage to the brain barrier. As a suitable alternative for
halting or reversing neurodegeneration, nanotherapeutics with the potential to cross the BBB
(without damage to the barrier) have been proposed and demonstrated in many cases [4,5].
Nanotherapeutic use is gaining traction due to the several bene its compared to conventional
dosage forms [6]. Despite this great progress, there is a need to re ine nanotherapeutics to ensure
optimum outcomes. In this review, we initially describe the pathophysiology of major NDs and
their current management strategies. We also discuss the role of BBB and other challenges for
brain-targeted drug delivery. Further, we look at the potential role of nanotherapeutics in the  ight
against neurodegeneration. Finally, we discuss breakthroughs and current  indings in
nanotherapeutics to manage NDs and provide perspectives for future applications.
2. Neurodegenerative Disorders (NDs)
Neurons are central to the proper functioning of the human brain since they play a critical role in
communication [7,8]. Most neurons originate in the brain; however, neurons are present
everywhere in the body [9,10]. During childhood, neural stem cells produce the majority of
neurons, the number of which is signi icantly reduced in adulthood [11]. Although neurons are not
immortal, the progressive loss of neurons, neuron structure, and/or their functions, known as
neurodegeneration, is central to the pathophysiology of several brain disorders [12] and is also a
major health concern. Neurodegeneration is associated with dysfunction of the synapse, neural
network, and the deposition of physiochemically altered variants of proteins in the brain (Figure
1) [13,14,15,16]. Diseases with neurodegeneration as their hallmark feature are collectively termed
NDs [17,18]. The most common NDs include Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, prion
disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, motor neuron disease, Huntington’s disease, spinal
muscular atrophy, and spinocerebellar ataxia [17,19,20,21].

Path to cognitive decline in neurodegeneration. Amyloid-beta (Aβ) monomers clump
together to form oligomers of variant structures. Subsequently, the oligomers aggregate to
form Aβ  ibers, which misarrange to form Aβ plaques. Plaque formation induces an
in lammatory response which includes the formation of tau aggregates leading to the
conversion of healthy neurons to diseased neurons. The presence of more diseased
neurons triggers another in lammatory response leading to more neuron loss and a
subsequent loss in brain function as well as cognitive decline.
Neurodegenerative disorders affect millions of people worldwide. Although age is the single most
contributing risk factor to the development of all NDs, recent  indings reveal that a combination of
an individual’s genetic makeup and environmental factors can equally contribute to increasing the
risk for NDs. Further, despite the expression of speci ic genes (within an individual) accountable
for NDs [22], the time and extent of neurodegeneration largely depend on their immediate
environment [23,24]. More recent studies reveal that multiple pathologies may underline a single
neurodegenerative disorder [25,26,27,28]. Thus, NDs can be very serious or even, in certain
instances, life threatening; however, it solely depends on the type and stage of the disease.

Since the brain controls several aspects of the body’s function, neurodegenerative diseases
consequently affect multiple facets of human functioning and limit the ability to perform both
basic (e.g., speech, movement, stability, and balance) and complicated tasks (e.g., bladder and bowel
functions, and cognitive abilities). Most NDs progress without remission, whilst in some cases,
treatments target the improvement of symptoms, relief of pain if present and/or the restoration of
balance and mobility. In the following sections we will brie ly discuss some common NDs.
2.1. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)
More recent studies of Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology have shown that the accumulation of
amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau proteins are central to AD progression [29,30]. The formation of Aβ-
containing plaques within the brain, linked with neuro ibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of
hyperphosphorylated tau, has been identi ied as the classical feature of AD [31,32,33]. Plaque
formation disrupts hippocampal circuitry leading to poor short-term memory consolidation into
long-term traces [34]. In AD, there is extensive neuronal loss, faulty synaptic connections, and
damage to the essential neurotransmitter systems necessary for brain functions, including
memory. Thus, the most common clinical symptom in early-stage AD is selective memory
impairment. In addition, hippocampus and medial temporal-lobe-dependent functions, such as
declarative episodic memory, are also often affected. Finally, executive function impairment,
judgment, and problem-solving are additional clinical manifestations and usually appear early
[35].
2.2. Parkinson’s Disease (PD)
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that leads to tremors, muscle stiffness,
an unsteady walk, and balance and coordination dif iculties. Both genetic and non-genetic stimuli
cause PD. Age is considered the primary risk factor for PD [36,37]. In addition, several other
factors, such as excessive caffeine intake, smoking, and exposure to environmental toxins, are
known to modulate the risk of development of PD [38], although the exact mechanism remains
unclear [39,40,41]. The pathophysiology of PD primarily includes frontal cortex atrophy and
ventricular enlargement. However, the most distinctive morphological alteration observed in the
PD brain is the loss of pigmentation in the locus coeruleus and substantia nigra pars compacta
(SNpc), which stems from the death of dopaminergic (DA) neuromelanin-containing neurons [42].
In PD, this signi icant cell loss results in dysfunction of the nigrostriatal pathway, culminating in
decreased dopamine concentration within the striatum, and consequently, the cardinal motor
symptoms [42]. Cell loss in different regions, including the nucleus basalis of Meynert, the raphe

nuclei, the locus coeruleus, the pedunculopontine nucleus, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus
nerve, the hypothalamus, and the olfactory bulb, account for the non-motor symptoms of PD [43].
Several mechanisms have been identi ied to play key roles in PD disease progression, and these
include α-synuclein misfolding and aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, dysfunctional protein
clearance systems, the ubiquitin–proteasome system, and autophagy–lysosome system, and
neuroin lammation [37,42,44].
Microscopically, the presence of Lewy bodies (abnormal cytoplasmic deposits which are
immunoreactive for the protein α-synuclein) within neuronal cell bodies, accompanied by
dystrophic neurites (Lewy neurites), characterize PD [36,45]. Lewy bodies may be phosphorylated
and spread to other regions of the CNS. Similar to AD, protein misfolding also occurs in PD [45],
and the protein that is commonly misfolded is the tau protein. The abnormal
hyperphosphorylation of tau protein leads to NFT formation. In a subgroup of PD patients, there
are widespread plaques of NFTs and amyloid-beta plaques [46].
2.3. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
ALS, more commonly referred to as motor neuron disease or Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a progressive
disease of the nerve cells and spinal cord, resulting in muscle weakness and paralysis [47,48]. In
ALS, motor neurons gradually deteriorate before they die [49]. When motor neurons are damaged
or dead, signals that should be sent to the brain are no longer delivered. Although over 30 different
genes have been associated with ALS, mutations in four main genes (C9orf72, TARDBP, SOD1, and
FUS) account for greater than 70% of ALS cases [49]. These four genes encode for proteins
involved in major motor function aspects such as DNA repair, homeostasis, mitochondrial
function, and glial cell function. A combination of these impaired functions is believed to
contribute to the degeneration of motor neurons observed in ALS. Accumulation of intraneuronal
protein aggregates is the pathological hallmark of ALS. The most abundant protein observed in
most ALS patients is the TAR DNA binding protein; however, other proteins such as superoxide
dismutase-1 and neuro ilament can also form aggregates [50,51]. Nonetheless, it is unclear
whether protein aggregates or protein complexes precede neuron damage or vice versa.
3. Current Therapeutic Approaches to Treat ND
Management of neurodegenerative disorders is often disease-speci ic. Several approaches to
management are currently accepted, which either target the disease pathogenesis or attempt to

3.1. Therapeutic Approaches for AD
Therapeutic approaches for managing AD focus mainly on targeting different pathways for disease
progression. Currently, there are three classes of drugs approved by US-FDA for the management of
AD, each of which is described below.
β
3.1.1. Antibody Targeting Amyloid-Beta (A ) Plaques
Aducanumab (Aduhelm) is the  irst disease-modifying drug approved for AD patients, and was
approved in June 2021 [52]. It is administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion over approximately
one hour every four weeks. Aducanumab is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody speci ic to extracellular
Aβ plaques in the brain, which binds and helps in clearing the plaques [52,53]. Although
conditionally approved, clinical data on aducanumab show a reduction in the Aβ plaques’ load, but
with no relationship to improved cognitive function in patients. More clinical data will still be
collected to provide conclusive evidence of whether the drug helps in cognitive functions.
However, the approval of aducanumab has also created a wave of excitement in AD patients and
advocacy groups. Besides being the  irst therapy to target altering the pathology of the disease,
they believe it will create avenues for similar therapies in the near future.
Multiple clinical trials have been performed using different bioactive molecules (i.e., secretase
inhibitors and therapeutic antibodies), but most of them have terminated so far. Some Aβ targeting
antibodies—AAB-003, MEDI1814, RO7126209, and SAR228810—have completed clinical trial
phase I. While aducanumab has completed clinical trial phase III, it is also speci ic towards Aβ
aggregation. Similarly, tau or TREM 2 speci ic antibodies, i.e., BIIB076, bepranemab, JNJ-63733657,
have completed clinical trial phase I, while gosuranemab is in clinical trial phase 2 [54]. Thus,
additional antibody-based targeting medicine may obtain FDA approval for AD treatment shortly.
3.1.2. Cholinesterase Inhibitors
Currently, cholinesterase inhibitors are the  irst-line medications administered for AD. Donepezil,
rivastigmine, and galantamine are the three main cholinesterase inhibitors used clinically. In AD,
there is an associated loss of cholinergic neurons and recession in the quantity of acetylcholine in
the cortical regions of the brain. Multiple studies have revealed that the increased supply of
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8837071/ 8/42

1/7/25, 10:13 AM A Review of the Common Neurodegenerative Disorders: Current Therapeutic Approaches and the Potential Role of Nanotherapeuti…
acetylcholine in demented patients helped diminish the cognitive decline. Cholinesterase
inhibitors limit acetylcholine degradation, and the patient bene its from increased cholinergic
activity [55].
Tacrine was the  irst choline esterase inhibitor approved back in 1993 by the FDA, but was
discontinued later because of its associated hepatotoxicity. Donepezil is used for mild-to-moderate
AD and is administered as oral tablets of 5 or 10 mg/day. More recently, higher doses of donepezil
(23 mg/day), alone or combined with memantine, were approved for moderate-to-severe patients.
Another acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used for mild-to-moderate AD is rivastigmine. Unlike other
cholinesterase inhibitors, rivastigmine is available as a transdermal patch and inhibits both
acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase enzymes. Galantamine, the next class of
cholinesterase inhibitors, was approved for mild-to-moderate AD at a dose range of 16–24 mg/day.
Besides its inhibitory effect on cholinesterase activity, it also produces allosteric modulation of
nicotinic cholinergic receptors [56].
Although numerous drugs have been developed for AD, cholinesterase inhibitors remain the only
option available to patients. The recently approved drug aducanumab is contentious in its ef icacy
and exorbitant in pricing. However, cholinesterase inhibitors show limited ef icacy. They achieve a
modest improvement in patients’ cognitive ability, and they are labeled as symptomatic treatment
options rather than altering the pathology [57]. Moreover, questions exist on whether current
medications can effectively cross the BBB at signi icant doses to elicit the desired pharmacological
effects.
3.1.3. Glutamate Regulators
Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. Through excessive activation in
postsynaptic neurons such as NMDA receptors, glutamates confer neuronal damage, leading to
neurodegeneration. However, complete inhibition of NMDA receptors has resulted in severe side
effects. Consequently, memantine, an uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, was developed,
which provides pathological bene its with NMDA receptor activation and also protects patients
from inhibitory effects due to overactivation [58].
Memantine was approved in 2003 for moderate-to-severe AD patients at a dose of 5–20 mg/day.
Monotherapy of memantine bene itted AD patients with improved cognition over a placebo. In
combination with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, clinical trials showed improved ef icacy for one
year over monotherapy [59,60]. However, this class of drugs also fails to address the pathology of
AD, and is mainly used to alleviate symptoms.

1/7/25, 10:13 AM A Review of the Common Neurodegenerative Disorders: Current Therapeutic Approaches and the Potential Role of Nanotherapeuti…
3.2. Therapeutic Approaches for PD
Although PD is the second most common ND, there is a lack of effective therapy that especially
alters the pathophysiology of the disease. Instead, some options address the motor-related
symptoms and non-motor-related symptoms separately for symptomatic relief in patients.
The principal approach in managing PD is to replenish the decreased dopamine levels in the
substantia nigra region of the brain. Numerous approaches have been put in place that aim to
replenish dopamine levels. The most common therapy is a combination of levodopa and carbidopa.
Levodopa is an immediate precursor of dopamine that helps restore motor functions resulting
from the loss of dopamine. Carbidopa is combined with levodopa to inhibit the peripheral
breakdown of levodopa before it reaches the brain. Additionally, entacapone and tolcapone are also
used to prevent methylation of levodopa through catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), thereby
preventing levodopa loss through methylation.
Dopaminergic agonists such as apomorphine hydrochloride, pergolide, pramipexole
dihydrochloride, ropinirole hydrochloride, and rotigotine, which produce an identical effect to
dopamine, are also available for the treatment of PD. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are the next
class of drugs available. They inhibit the oxidative deamination of dopamine in the brain and
prevent dopamine loss. Selegiline and rasagiline are the two examples of monoamine oxidase
inhibitors [39].
PD is associated with major non-motor symptoms (MNMS) like all NDs, including depression,
psychosis, sleep disorders, constipation, dementia, and olfactory de icit, and they are treated
symptomatically [61]. Rivastigmine, donepezil, and galantamine are prescribed to alleviate
dementia-related symptoms. Clozapine, quetiapine, and pimavanserin are approved medications
for treating psychosis-related symptoms. The use of melatonin or clonazepam is suggested for
sleep-related symptoms [62].
3.3. Therapeutic Approaches for ALS
ALS is a motor neuron disease that manifests the symptoms of frontotemporal dementia,
behavioral changes, and cognitive decline with the progression of the disease. ALS patients
succumb to respiratory failure and death within three to  ive years of the appearance of symptoms
[63]. There are two approved medications for ALS patients, i.e., riluzole and edaravone. Riluzole, a
glutamate-receptor antagonist, was approved back in 1995 as an oral tablet with a dose of 100
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8837071/ 10/42

1/7/25, 10:13 AM A Review of the Common Neurodegenerative Disorders: Current Therapeutic Approaches and the Potential Role of Nanotherapeuti…
mg/day. Clinical trials have shown that riluzole use prolongs the life of ALS patients by 3 to 4
months compared to a placebo group. Edaravone, a free-radical scavenger, was recently approved
in 2017 as an intravenous infusion with a dose of 60 mg/day, and it helps to delay the progression
of the disease [64]. Besides these medications, patients are treated symptomatically for the
improvement in their quality of life. There are no concrete disease-modifying therapies available
as of now.
4. Challenges of Brain-Drug Delivery
Current therapy for the management of NDs has aided in controlling the progression of the disease
rather than eliminate the root causes. The problem of neurodegeneration lies behind the BBB, and
that is where most of these formulations fail. The inability to transport suf icient doses to the
brain limits the successful intervention of NDs. The advanced nature of the BBB, coupled with the
poor permeative potency of most, if not all drugs, accounts for the lack of suitable treatment
options for NDs.
4.1. The Blood–Brain Barrier (BBB)
The BBB has been described as a diffusion barrier that prevents substances in the blood from
entering the brain, allowing the maintenance of homeostasis and the brain’s normal functioning
[65]. Different cells in the brain (brain microvascular endothelial cells, tight junctions, neurons,
astrocytes, and basal membranes) fuse to build a physically tight brain capillary in the BBB [66].
The absence of fenestrations within the brain capillary endothelial cells limits the diffusion of
small molecules and proteins [67,68]. The endothelial cells are further linked to a continuous
barrier through inter-endothelial junctions, restricting the transport of water-soluble substances
[69,70]. Furthermore, the endothelial cells are surrounded by the basal lamina, astrocytes, and
pericytes, limiting access to drug molecules from the blood to the brain [71]. The strength of this
barrier is complimented by ef lux transporters located in the brain capillary, and these
transporters return substances that enter the brain back into the bloodstream [72]. In addition, the
permeability function of the BBB is further regulated by intere-ndothelial junctions, which are
protein complexes including tight junctions, gap junctions, and adherens junctions [65,73].
Molecules that cross the BBB either go through the paracellular or transcellular pathway [73]. The
physicochemical properties of compounds that allow their transport across the BBB include the
size, molecular weight, surface activity, lipid solubility, and charge [74,75]. Some small molecules
(such as ethanol, carbon dioxide, and barbiturates) freely cross the BBB through passive diffusion
[76,77]. Receptor-mediated transport mechanisms including the insulin transporter, transferrin
receptor, and glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) [78] also aid the transport of hydrophilic molecules

such as peptides and proteins [76]. Further, some pathologic states are known to disrupt the
tightness of the BBB, allowing the leakage of substances into the brain [79,80,81,82]. Finally, the
use of specialized drug carriers such as nanoparticles can enhance the transport of cargos across
the BBB. A few of these instances are discussed below.
4.2. Pharmacokinetic Principles and Their E ects on Brain-Drug Delivery
The ef icacy of systematically administered drugs is mostly determined by their pharmacokinetic
characteristics [83]. From the point of administration to the target site (in this case, the brain) is a
harrowing journey that, in most cases, does not favor the therapeutic molecules. The  irst point of
attention is the presence of various plasma proteins that are embedded within. Some drugs are
highly bound to these proteins, thereby limiting the amount of the drug available in circulation,
ultimately reducing the free drug available for transportation to the brain [84]. Additionally, some
drugs are uneliminated by the major clearance organs at a signi icant rate, leaving only a few
within the bloodstream. In addition, the interaction between drug and target cells limits the extent
of drug absorption. More speci ically, drug molecules can affect cells that lead to the blocking of
channels, a change in membrane potential, or even an alteration in cell conformation. This
transient effect can limit the behavior of the cell towards the administered drug molecule and its
absorption [85]. In general, small lipophilic drug molecules are suitable for brain delivery [86].
5. Nanoparticles and Their Use in NDs
Limitations caused by the BBB and the disadvantages of the current therapies, as mentioned above,
have led to the unmet need for new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of NDs [87]. Out of
the approaches employed, nanotechnology has emerged as a safe and promising platform for
targeted drug/gene delivery to the CNS [88,89]. This technology employs materials in nanoscale,
usually ranging from 1–1000 nm, and can interact with biological systems at the molecular level
[90]. A variety of materials such as natural polymers (proteins and polysaccharides), synthetic
polymers (PLGA and PCL), and inorganic materials (gold, silver, and cerium) have been employed
to formulate nanoparticles. Nanocarriers have proven to be highly suitable drug/gene carriers to
the brain [91]. The characteristics of nanocarriers that make them a promising platform for
managing and treating NDs include high drug loading capacity, low systemic toxicity, improved
drug permeabilization, and good physical and chemical stability [88].
Nanoparticles with varying sizes, properties, and functions have been developed for brain-drug
delivery; their forms are provided in Figure 2. However, their penetration through the BBB
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8837071/ 12/42

depends on the size, surface chemistry, type, and polarity of the nanocarriers [92]. Additionally, the
surface coating with polysorbate can help evade transmembrane ef lux systems such as P-
glycoprotein pumps [92]. Liposomal and polymeric nanoparticles have been the most exploited for
targeted brain delivery due to the ease of surface modi ication with ligands and cell-penetrating
peptides (CPPs) [78,93,94,95,96].

Here, we discuss the nanoparticles most commonly studied for the management of NDs.
5.1. Inorganic Nanoparticles
Metal nanoparticles have gained much interest due to their ability to easily cross the BBB and
accumulate in the brain [97,98]. Their various properties, such as size, surface modi ications, and
stability, can be easily modulated for ef icient brain targeting [98]. For instance, metal

nanoparticles are often functionalized with various brain-targeted ligands, such as antibodies,
proteins, and small molecules (e.g., mannose) for enhanced drug delivery to the CNS. These
nanoparticles are also widely known for their theragnostic and imaging applications [99,100].
Among various metallic nanoparticles, gold, silver, and cerium nanoparticles have been the most
exploited for CNS delivery [97] and will be discussed here.
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been extensively used in CNS imaging and targeting [101]. Their
core has plasmonic properties (i.e., the ability to interact with electromagnetic radiation due to
the presence of free electrons), making them ideal for imaging applications using micro-CT
scanning or X-rays. The AuNPs are superior in absorbing and reducing the X-rays better than the
conventional contrast agents, which allows for higher contrast and precise visualization of the
nanoparticles [100]. In a recent study, rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RITC) and poly-L-lysine (PLL)
were complexed with 40 nm AuNPs. These modi ications increased nanoparticle uptake in human
mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). This gold-labeled hMSC was directly injected into rat brains and
could be visualized 30 min post-injection using the micro-CT [102]. In combination with cell
tracking and visualization, AuNPs have shown great potential in targeting and degrading β-
amyloid aggregates under in vitro conditions [103]. Apolipoprotein E3 (ApoE3) conjugated with
the core of the AuNPs, promoted their interaction with the amyloid aggregates and increased
penetration in the brain. Curcumin was used as a probe to track these AuNPs. Upon binding of
amyloid aggregates and ApoE3-AuNPs, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the AuNPs was
used to dissociate the amyloid aggregates by 60% [104]. In another study, AuNPs were surface-
modi ied with brain-targeted exosomes for more effective and enhanced brain delivery [105]. Sub-
cellular size, unique size-dependent physicochemical and optical properties, adaptability, and
biocompatibility of AuNPs make them suitable carriers for brain-targeted delivery of small
molecules and biomacromolecules [106]. In a different report, gold nanoparticles differentiated
mouse embryonic stem cells into dopaminergic neurons [107].
Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have also been explored for brain-targeted drug delivery. After
intraperitoneal injection, the AgNPs reached and accumulated in the hippocampus, which is
known to be an essential region for NDs [108]. It was noted that a 5µg/mL dose of these
nanoparticles could induce an in lammatory and neurodegenerative gene expression response in
mice’s neural cells [98,109]. AgNPs have been used to deliver a myriad of drugs to the brain,
ranging from alisertib for glioblastoma [106] to anti-amoebic drugs to treat brain-eating amoebae
[110]. Another study highlighted the anti-in lammatory and antioxidant properties of citrate-
capped AgNPs on microglia, the brain’s immune cells. These AgNPs were absorbed speci ically by
microglia, which in turn led to the expression of enzymes that reduced reactive oxygen species and
had anti-in lammatory properties [111]. However, a drawback evidenced with AgNPs is their

mechanism of entry into the brain, which involves disruption of the BBB by weakening the tight
junctions. They also seem to induce neuronal degeneration and necrosis by accumulating inert
silver in the brain over a long period [112,113,114].
Cerium oxide nanoparticles are most known for their role in reducing oxygen species (ROS), linked
to neuronal death and NDs. The transition of oxidation states between Ce+3 and Ce+4 is the reason
behind the excellent antioxidant property these nanoparticles display [115]. These nanoparticles
have proven to retard the apoptotic effect of AD in neuronal cells by altering the brain-derived
neurotrophic factor signal transduction pathway, and showed the potential to decline Aβ-
aggregation when combined with PEG coatings or metal chelators [116]. Besides this, cerium oxide
nanoparticles have effectively scavenged peroxynitrite ROS in ischemic stroke models and
restored limb motor function in multiple-sclerosis- and ALS-mouse models [117]. Recently, several
nanoparticle-based formulations have been documented with neurogenesis potential. Zavvari et al.,
2020 explored the neurogenesis ef icacy of cerium dioxide (CeO ) nanoparticles. They claimed that
2
single-dose administration of CeO nanoparticles was enough to initiate neurogenesis in the
2
hippocampal region. This is due to the anti-in lammatory and neuro-regenerative potency of
cerium oxide [118].
Several documented reports con irm behavioral or functional improvements in vivo when treated
with nanoparticles. For example, Wu et al., 2020 explored that iron-oxide-nanoparticle-tagged
MNCs were able to migrate from the administered site to the choroid plexus and trigger a
functional recovery in the ischemic-stroke brain. The author suggested that MNCs could be more
bene icial if administered directly into the lateral ventricles instead of intravenously [119].
5.2. Organic Nanoparticles
Naturally occurring molecules, such as lipids and other organic molecules, can be exploited as
tools for delivering nanomedicine due to their superior biocompatibility compared to inorganic
materials. Moreover, a lipid nanocarrier is more effective in protecting the therapeutic moiety
from degradation, reducing toxicity and increasing biocompatibility, than the free-drug
administration [116]. Among the different lipid carriers, liposomes have been the most extensively
explored for brain-targeted delivery. Liposomes dual functionalized with mApoE and phosphatidic
acid were developed to enhance delivery across the BBB and target Aβ aggregates with high
af inity [120]. This liposomal formulation could disaggregate Aβ  ibrils in vitro. The negatively
charged phosphatidic acid interacts with the positively charged amino acid residues on the Aβ,
while the mApoE interacts with the negatively charged regions of the same.

1/7/25, 10:13 AM A Review of the Common Neurodegenerative Disorders: Current Therapeutic Approaches and the Potential Role of Nanotherapeuti…
In a recent study, our lab has developed surface-modi ied liposomes for brain-targeted delivery of
ApoE2-encoding plasmid DNA [121]. The targeting ligand used was mannose along with a CPP
(penetratin and rabies virus glycoprotein peptide, RVG) to enhance brain-targeting and cellular
internalization, respectively. Similarly, liposomes modi ied with RVG and transferrin displayed
superior uptake in brain endothelial cells, astrocytes, and neurons as compared to plain liposomes
[94]. In a separate study by Rodriguez et al. [93], surface functionalization of liposomes with
transferrin and a CPP was suf icient to improve the brain permeability of liposomes in mice after a
single intravenous administration. In all of these studies, drug accumulation in the brain was
attributed the surface functionalization.
Similarly, optimized brain targeting liposomes, functionalized with mannose and either RVG,
penetratin, rabies-derived peptide (RDP), or CGNHPHLAKYNGT (CGN) peptide suf iciently
delivered VGF (VGF nerve growth factor inducible) across in vitro BBB models and in vivo mouse
models. In this study the authors observed a 1.5–2.0-fold (p < 0.05) higher transfection in
functionalized-liposome-treated mice compared to an untreated control-mouse group (Figure 3).
Further, the formulated liposome nanoparticles were biocompatible both in vivo and in vitro
[122].

Antioxidants can protect the neurons from amyloid-β-plaque-mediated oxidative damage.
Curcumin has displayed promising antioxidant potential against various NDs [123]. It binds to the
Aβ deposits, disrupts aggregation, and disaggregates pre-formed  ibril, both in vitro and in vivo
[124,125]. Besides liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) have also been used for brain-
targeted delivery of therapeutics to manage various NDs. Rosmarinic-acid-loaded SLNs were
administered intranasally to ameliorate the behavioral dysfunctions and oxidative stress
associated with Huntington’s disease [126].
Nanomicelle, particularly polymeric nanomicelle, has emerged as a potential vehicle to deliver
diverse therapeutic agents [127,128]. Depending on their hydrophilic and hydrophobic
characteristics, polymers that self-assemble to form micelles can do so at reasonably lower
concentrations while maintaining a small internal diameter, suf icient to carry cargo [129]. More
recently, some studies have demonstrated the ability of functionalized chitosan nanomicelles to
transfect the brain cells at effective concentrations [130]. Chitosan nanomicelles present the
advantages of being biodegradable, nontoxic at the concentration of use, and  lexible towards
surface modi ication [131]. These advantages make chitosan nanomicelles an excellent carrier for
delivering drugs, proteins, genes, and even antibodies to the brain. Recently, Xue et al. [132],
conjugated chitosan nanoparticles signi icantly inhibited by α-syn aggregation in vitro, as well as
discovering signi icant neuroprotective effects in Parkinson disease models. Chitosan can equally

be used in conjugation with other polymers to enhance delivery across the BBB. In a separate
study by Jaruszewski et al. [133], Chitosan-coated PLGA nanoparticles had a better BBB uptake
compared to naked PLGA nanoparticles.
While different polymeric formulations have been employed in the production of nanoparticles,
poly D, L-(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) has been extensively used for brain-targeted and
controlled drug delivery [134]. This biodegradable, biocompatible polymer, with adjustable
degradation rates, a high drug loading capacity, and the ability to cross through the BBB to target
the brain, makes it an ideal carrier system for treating NDs. In one study, TET1 peptide-coated
PLGA nanoparticles were used to encapsulate and deliver a hydrophilic drug, nattokinase, to the
brain. The TET1 peptide demonstrated a high af inity for neurons and promoted retrograde
transport. This formulation successfully improved the stability of the nattokinase protein and
downregulated amyloid aggregation, proving to be a vital option for treating AD [135]. A separate
study by Carradori et al. synthesized Anti Aβ1-42 conjugated poly (alkyl cyanoacrylate)
nanoparticles directed toward Aβ1-42. When transgenic AD mice were treated with these
nanoparticles, there was a signi icant decrease in the brain and plasma level of Aβ soluble peptide
and its oligomer, resulting in corrected memory defect [136].
In a separate study by Safari et al., phosphatidylserine nanoliposomes also improved the memory
of AD-induced rats when loaded with metformin. In this study, IL1-β, TNF-α, and TGF- β levels
were found to be reduced in the hippocampal region. Neurogenesis was observed along with
signi icantly reduced necrosis and neuroin lammation [137].
As we have discussed, nanoparticles are capable of initiating neurogenesis in in vivo systems, but
nanoparticles have also been explored to aid stem cells’ differentiation into neurons. For example,
polycaprolactone-lignin nanoparticles triggered neurogenesis and neurite outgrowth in PC12 and
hADSCs cells. The developed nano-scaffold was biocompatible and safe. The author claimed that
the incorporation of 15% lignin nanoparticles improved the expected outcomes: neuro-
construction and regeneration [138]. Similarly, NGF-loaded chitosan nanoparticles differentiated
canine mesenchymal stem cells into neuronal cells [139].
Similarly, RA-NPs improved neuronal cell differentiation, survival, and viability in neural stem
cells after the ischemic effect [113].

There is an utmost need to develop novel treatment strategies against neurodegenerative
disorders, that pause neurodegeneration rather than provide symptomatic relief. Several studies
on nanoparticles, show promise of an effective drug delivery approach, which can be a ray of hope
against neurodegenerative disorders.
A recent search in ongoing clinical trials revealed less than 10 nanoparticle-based formulations
under different phases of clinical trials against NDs (Table 2). Only one clinical trial of lipid
nanoparticle-based formulation for transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis has been completed and
approved for sale in public. While a (CRISPR)/Cas9 gene-based study is in the clinical trial phase I,
lipid nanoparticles are being used as a drug delivery platform for this study. An exciting approach
of nanoparticle-mediated delivery of APH-1105 against mild-to-moderate AD is enlisted; this
clinical trial will be started in 2023. However, a gold-nanoparticle-mediated CNM-Au8 delivery
approach is in the clinical trial phase 2. On the other hand, multiple studies of CNM-Au8-gold
nanocrystals-based studies are in phase 1 and phase 2 of clinical trials against ALS.

7. Challenges, Future Prospects and Conclusions
Neuronal death is the primary characteristic of NDs, i.e., AD and Parkinson’s. Therefore,
neurogenesis is the most envisioned treatment strategy for these disorders. However, drug
delivery to the brain is still a challenge due to multiple crucial factors, including the BBB,
lipophilicity, the molecular weight of the drug, etc. These factors limit the therapeutic potency of
drugs and make NDs more challenging to treat. Thus, nanoparticle-mediated targeted drug
delivery to the brain has been explored in recent years for neurogenesis, and it provides a
promising platform for improving treatment strategies. Despite these potential advantages,
nanocarrier-mediated drug delivery has some challenging aspects, including safety, production,
and regulations.
The toxicity of nanoparticles primarily depends on size, surface charge, ionic dissolutions, and
shape. These features should be considered for developing nanoparticle-based drug-delivery
systems as per the of icial nanotoxicity guidelines [140]. Additionally, the approval of these
nanocarriers should be critically examined, including the effects on health and the environment
[141]. A great pool of literature suggests several amendments to minimize the toxicity associated
with the size and charge, such as surface modi ication with biodegradable- or bio-molecules of
intrinsic origin [142,143]. As far as the production of nanocarriers is concerned, they should
maintain batch-to-batch uniformity in terms of their size and content. There are multiple methods
documented for nanoparticle production, including high-pressure homogenization, microemulsion,
extrusion etc.
Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic properties of the nanotherapeutics greatly impact its ef icacy
and toxicity. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the pharmacokinetic parameters of
nanotherapeutics in a relevant animal model. In this regard, Pharmacokinetic and more advanced
physiologically based pharmacokinetic models can be utilized as a potential tool to predict the in

vivo nature of nanotherapeutics [144]. Additionally, regulatory requirements for the clinical
acceptance of nanotherapeutics should be considered critically [145].
Nanomedicine is a ray of hope for NDs, and it can be an effective tool to overrule the barriers of
current and traditional treatment approaches [146]. We highlighted nanoparticle-based reports
against various NDs, which may open the prospect of nanomedicine. Understandably, the
development of curative treatment is not an immediate process, but preliminary research in the
 ield may lead to a steppingstone that can help eradicate NDs. However, to prove the ef icacy
against NDs, the generation of more in vitro and in vivo data is needed. Furthermore, thorough in
vitro and in vivo investigations and their correlation establishment are required to assess the
ef icacy of nanoparticles. This would help the research fraternity to extend or identify the effective
nanoparticles for diagnostic or therapeutic applications.

Abstract
Yongjun Wang and colleagues discuss the de inition of brain health and the opportunities and
challenges of future research
The human brain is the command centre for the nervous system and enables thoughts, memory,
movement, and emotions by a complex function that is the highest product of biological evolution.
Maintaining a healthy brain during one’s life is the uppermost goal in pursuing health and
longevity. As the population ages, the burden of neurological disorders and challenges for the
preservation of brain health increase. It is therefore vital to understand what brain health is and
why it is important. This article is the  irst in a series that aims to de ine brain health, analyse the
effect of major neurological disorders on brain health, and discuss how these disorders might be
treated and prevented.

Currently, there is no universally recognised de inition of brain health. Most existing de initions
have only a general description of normal brain function or emphasise one or two dimensions of
brain health. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention de ined brain health as an ability
to perform all the mental processes of cognition, including the ability to learn and judge, use
language, and remember.1 The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association
(AHA/ASA) presidential advisory de ined optimal brain health as “average performance levels
among all people at that age who are free of known brain or other organ system diseases in terms
of decline from function levels, or as adequacy to perform all activities that the individual wishes
to undertake.”2
The brain is a complex organ and has at least three levels of functions that affect all aspects of our
daily lives: interpretation of senses and control of movement; maintenance of cognitive, mental,
and emotional processes; and maintenance of normal behaviour and social cognition. Brain health
may therefore be de ined as the preservation of optimal brain integrity and mental and cognitive
function at a given age in the absence of overt brain diseases that affect normal brain function.
E ect of major neurological disorders on brain health
Several neurological disorders may disrupt brain function and affect humans’ health. Medically,
neurological disorders that cause brain dysfunction can be classi ied into three groups:
Brain diseases with overt damage to brain structures, such as cerebrovascular diseases,
traumatic brain injury, brain tumours, meningitis, and communication and sensory disorders
Functional brain disorders with detectable destruction of brain connections or networks,
such as neurodegenerative diseases (eg, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and other
dementias) and mental disorders (eg, schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, alcoholism,
and drug abuse)
Other brain disorders without detectable structural or functional impairment, such as
migraine and sleep disorders.
These neurological disorders may have different or common effects on brain health and function.
For instance, Alzheimer’s disease is the main type of dementia, with a decline in different domains
of cognitive function. Mood disorders may cause dysfunction in execution, reward processing, and
emotional regulations. In addition to physical disability, aphasia, gait and balance problems, and
cerebrovascular diseases may lead to cognitive impairment and dementia, which are neglected by
both patients and physicians.

Ageing and burden of neurological disorders
Human ageing is mainly re lected in the aspects of brain ageing and degradation of brain function.
The number of people aged 60 years and over worldwide was around 900 million in 2015 and is
expected to grow to two billion by 2050.3 With the increases in population ageing and growth, the
burden of neurological disorders and challenges to the preservation of brain health steeply
increase. People with neurological disorders will have physical disability, cognitive or mental
disorders, and social dysfunction and be a large economic burden.
Globally, neurological disorders were the leading cause of disability adjusted life years (276
million) and the second leading cause of death (9 million) in 2016, according to the Global Burden
of Diseases study.4 Stroke, migraine, Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, and meningitis are
the largest contributors to neurological disability adjusted life years.4 About one in four adults
will have a stroke in their lifetime, from the age of 25 years onwards.5 Roughly 50 million people
worldwide were living with dementia in 2018, and the number will more than triple to 152 million
by 2050.6 In the following decades, governments will face increasing demand for treatment,
rehabilitation, and support services for neurological disorders.
Opportunities and challenges of future research on brain health
Opportunities and challenges exist in the assessment of brain health, the mechanism of brain
function and dysfunction, and approaches to promote brain health (box 1).
Box 1. Opportunities and challenges of future research on brain health.
Lack of metrics or tools to comprehensively assess or quantify brain health
Little knowledge about the mechanisms of brain function and dysfunction
Few effective approaches to prevent and treat brain dysfunction in some major
neurological disorders, such as dementia
Need to precisely preserve brain functions for people with neurosurgical diseases
De ining and promoting optimal brain health require the scienti ic evaluation of brain health.
However, it is dif icult to comprehensively evaluate or quantify brain health through one metric
owing to the multidimensional aspects of brain health. Many structured or semistructured
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7555053/ 3/10

1/7/25, 10:13 AM What is brain health and why is it important? - PMC
questionnaires have been developed to test brain health by self-assessments or close family
member assessments of daily function or abilities. In recent decades new structural and functional
neuroimaging techniques have been applied to evaluate brain network integrity and functional
connectivity.7 However, these subjective or objective measures have both strengths and
weaknesses. For instance, scales such as the mini-mental state examination and Montreal cognitive
assessment are simple and easy to implement but are used only as global screening tools for
cognitive impairment; tests such as the digit span, Rey-Osterrieth complex  igure test, trail making
A and B, Stroop task, verbal  luency test, Boston naming test, and clock drawing test are used
mainly to assess one or two speci ic domains of memory, language, visuospatial, attention, and
executive function; and neuroimaging techniques, although non-invasive and objective, still have
disadvantages of test contraindications, insuf icient temporal or spatial resolution, motion
artefact, and high false discovery rates, which limit their clinical transformation.
Another dif iculty in measuring brain health is that age, culture, ethnicity, and geography speci ic
variations exist in the perception of optimal brain health. Patient centred assessment of brain
function, such as self-perception of cognitive function and quality of life, should also be considered
when measuring brain health.8 Universal acceptable, age appropriate, multidimensional,
multidisciplinary, and sensitive metrics or tools are required to comprehensively measure and
monitor brain function and brain health.
To promote optimal brain health, we need a better understanding of the mechanisms of brain
function and dysfunction. Unfortunately, little is known about the working mechanism of the brain.
Although we have made considerable developments in neuroscience in recent decades, we still
cannot totally decipher the relations between spatiotemporal patterns of activity across the
interconnected networks of neurons and thoughts or the cognitive and mental state of a person.9
Recent progress in brain simulation and arti icial intelligence provides a vital tool to understand
biological brains, and vice versa.10 11 The development of brain inspired computation, brain
simulation, and intelligent machines was emphasised in the European Union and China Brain
Project.9 12
Meanwhile, the mechanisms behind the brain dysfunction in some neurological disorders are still
not well understood, especially for mental and neurodegenerative disorders. Further investigation
of the mechanisms of brain diseases may indicate approaches to treatment and improve brain
function. Brain imaging based cognitive neuroscience may unravel the underlying brain
mechanism of cognitive dysfunction and provide an avenue to develop a biological framework for
precision biomarkers of mood disorders.13

Most common neurological diseases, such as cerebrovascular diseases and Alzheimer’s disease,
have complex aetiopathologies, typically involving spatial-temporal interactions of genetic and
environmental factors. However, a single genetic factor could account for the disease progression
of monogenic neurological disorders. These diseases could be more readily investigated by
simpli ied cross species modelling, leading to better understanding of their mechanisms and
greater ef iciency in testing innovative therapies. Such research may provide a window to promote
the investigation of common neurological disorders and general brain health, as discussed by Chen
and colleagues elsewhere in this series.14
Few effective approaches are available to prevent and treat brain dysfunction in some major
neurological disorders, such as dementia. Neurons are not renewable, and brain dysfunction is
always irreversible. Recent trials targeting amyloid clearance and the selective inhibition of tau
protein aggregation failed to improve cognition or modify disease progression in patients with
mild Alzheimer’s disease.15 16 More attention has focused on other potential therapeutic targets,
such as vascular dysfunction, in lammation, and the gut microbiome, as discussed by Shi and
colleagues.17 In particular, recent studies showed that the early impairment of cognition was
induced by the disruption of neurovascular unit integrity, which may cause hypoperfusion and the
breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and subsequent impairment in the clearance of proteins in
the brain.18 19 Physical activity, mental exercise, a healthy diet and nutrition, social interaction,
ample sleep and relaxation, and control of vascular risk factors are considered six pillars of brain
health. The AHA/ASA presidential advisory recommended the AHA’s Life’s Simple 7 (non-smoking,
physical activity, healthy diet, appropriate body mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and
blood glucose) to maintain optimal brain health.2 Pan and colleagues discuss how this may
indicate a new dawn of preventing some cognitive impairment and brain dysfunction by
preventing vascular risk factors or cerebrovascular diseases.20
For other neurological disorders with potential therapeutic approaches, the main aim is to
preserve brain function. Impaired brain function due to anatomical structural damage is
underestimated in patients with neurosurgical diseases such as brain tumours, trauma, and
epilepsy. In recent years, treatment targets for neurosurgical diseases have changed from focusing
on survival or life expectancy to balancing brain structures and functions. Precise preservation of
brain function requires an understanding of the exquisite relation between brain structure and
function and advanced technologies to visualise brain structure-function relations.21
Another example of the predicament associated with protection of brain function is uncertainty in
the treatment response in epilepsy management. Current standard care for epilepsy relies on a
trial and error approach of sequential regimens of antiseizure medications. The time delay due to
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7555053/ 5/10

1/7/25, 10:13 AM What is brain health and why is it important? - PMC
this treatment approach means that such treatments may be less effective and irreversible damage
may occur. Chen and colleagues22 describe how recent advances in personalised epilepsy
management based on arti icial intelligence, genomics, and patient derived stem cells are bringing
some hope to overcome this predicament in epilepsy management and promise a more effective
strategy.23 24
Brain health is the maintenance of multidimensional aspects of brain function. However, several
neurological disorders may affect brain health in one or more aspects of brain function.
Deciphering and promoting the function and health of the brain, the most mysterious organ in the
human body, will have a dramatic impact on science, medicine, and society.25 In the past seven
years, a number of large scale brain health initiatives have been launched in several countries to
promote the development of neuroscience, brain simulation, and brain protection.9 However,
further challenges are raised by the different key research directions of brain projects in different
countries. In the face of these challenges, Liu and colleagues argue that collaboration on brain
health research is urgently needed.26 As the other articles in this series describe, coordinated
research has enormous potential to improve the prognosis of brain disorders.
Key messages.
Brain health is the preservation of optimal brain integrity and mental and cognitive
function and the absence of overt neurological disorders
Human ageing increases the burden of brain dysfunction and neurological diseases
and the demands for medical resources
Further studies are required to assess brain health, understand the mechanism of
brain function and dysfunction, and explore effective approaches to promote brain
health.

Abstract:
Background:
Due to the stressful life, brain disorders are considered as a significant global healthcare problem. It has generated a great need for continuous
research for understanding brain structure as well as functions in context to health and diseases.
Scope and Approach:
The structure and functions of the brain were questioned and studied since Ancient Greek times and led to the compilation of enormous
information on the subject globally. With the advent of new technology, the researchers are able to discover the causes of brain diseases/disorders.
Conclusion:
In the present review, we have compiled various diseases and disorders related to the brain, along with their symptoms and the treatment strategies.

Neurology
Neurological problems can be caused by infections, neurodegenerative disorders, trauma, con-
genital defects, vascular problems, and tumors. This section is an introduction to neurological
diagnosis andthemainfeatures ofimportantneurologicalconditions.
Neurological Diagnosis
Thefirststepinmedicaldiagnosisisalwaysagoodhistory,lookingatthepatient'scurrentprob-

historyisfollowedbyaclinicalexaminationtogatherinformationonfunctionsofthebrainand

- cranialnervefunctions
- motorfunctions andreflexes
- skinsensation
- coordination
- psychologicalstates
Sometimes a diagnosis is already evident after these two examination steps. However, further
special tests are usually carried out to confirm the diagnosis or exclude similar diseases.These
tests may include imaging methods (CT and MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), elec-
tromyography(EMG),nerveconductionstudies,lumbarpuncture(spinaltap),bloodtests,and
biopsy.Thesetests willbedescribedinalittlemoredetaillater.

Motor Signs
Themostsignificantelements of theexaminationof motorfunctions are:
- detectionofparesis orparalysis
- changes inmuscletoneandreflexes
- abnormalspontaneous movements
Paralysis
It is important to distinguish between central paralysis (impairment of the corticospinal tract
neurons)andperipheralparalysis (impairmentofthemotorneuron).
Damagetothecorticospinaltractneuronsisusuallyassociatedwithspasticparalysis,inwhich
lossoffinemotorskillsisassociatedwithincreasedmuscletone(spastictone)andexaggerated
reflexes.
Whenmotorneuronsaredamaged,flaccidparalysisoccurs.Thistypeofparalysisischaracter-
ized by loss or reduction in muscle strength, loss of muscle tone (flaccidity), loss of reflexes,
andloss oftheparalyzedmuscles' mass.
Spasticparalysis
Spastic paralysis occurs after major central nervous system damage, such as after a stroke. In
spastic paralysis, the main structures affected are the corticospinal tract and parts of the basal
ganglia – the corticospinal damage causes the paralysis, and the associated basal ganglia dam-
age causes increased tone and hyperreflexia. The most common site of damage in these cases
is the internal capsule (which contains the corticospinal tract) and the adjacent putamen, cau-
date,andglobus pallidus.
In spastic paralysis, the muscle tone is increased on the affected side, and reflexes (such as the
patellar reflex) are exaggerated. Often there is an abnormal reflex called the Babinski sign, in
whichfirmstrokingofthesoleof thefootcauses thebigtoextendratherthanflex.
Thediagnosticimportanceofthedifferencebetweenspasticandflaccidparalysisledto
theuseofanunfortunatenomenclaturebyneurologistsinthetwentiethcentury;spastic
paralysis was called 'upper motor neuron (UMN)' paralysis, and flaccid paralysis was
called 'lower motor neuron (LMN)' paralysis. This nomenclature attempted to charac-
terize the corticospinal pathway as the upper motor neuron was a light-hearted way of
saying that the pyramidal cells of the motor cortex were similar to the actual motor
neurons in the brain stem spinal cord. This terminology is misleading and should be
avoided.
Flaccidparalysis
Damage to the motor neurons or their axons can occur in many different ways. In the cases of
motor neuron disease and polio, the cell bodies of the motor neurons are directly affected.
Nonetheless, the most common causes of flaccid paralysis are damage to the axons of motor
neurons,asoccursinthecranialandspinalnerves,thelimbplexuses,andtheindividualnerves

The sensory speech area is located on the posterior third of the upper surface of the superior

planum temporale is much larger on the left side than on the right – consistent with the large
area occupied by the sensory speech area. The sensory speech area is named after Carl Wer-
nicke, a German neurologist of the late nineteenth century. It is defined as area 22 in the Brod-
mannclassificationofcorticalareas.
The motor speech area is located in the inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant cerebral hemi-
sphere. Motor or expressive aphasia) is named after the French physician and anthropologist
Paul Broca, who lived in the middle of the nineteenth century.The inferior frontal gyrus com-

Semanticandepisodicmemory
The ability of the human cortex to store thousands of memories allows us to make fine
distinctions and accumulate detailed knowledge of the way the world works. This en-
ablesustomakeaccurateandusefulpredictionsabouttheresultsofplannedbehaviors.
Therecollectionofexperiencecanbeclassifiedaseithersemanticorepisodic.Semantic
memory relates to a generalized impression of several experiences, such as the move-
ment of falling objects, the texture of water, and the meaning of a pattern of sounds.
Semantic memory enables understanding rather than a recollection of specific experi-
ences.
On the other hand, episodic memory is linked to specific experiences at a particular
time and place. The distinction between the two forms of memory is not always clear-
cut.Forinstance,wemayknowsomethingtobetrue(semanticmemory).Nevertheless,
we may recall a particular learning experience that taught us that fact (episodic mem-
ory). Many pieces of knowledge depend on many episodic experiences. However, the
semantic memory can remain in the long term even when the individual episodes are
forgotten.
ThecaseofHenryMolaison
Thehippocampusisprimarilyinvolvedwiththeformationofmemories,anditdoesnot
appeartobedirectlyinvolvedinconsciousness.However,withoutthehippocampus,an
individual may experience severe distortions of consciousness because, without access
to recent memories, they cannot create a context for their surroundings. This is sup-
ported by studies of many patients with hippocampal damage, including the famous
case of Henry Molaison (HM), a patient of William Scoville whom Brenda Milner has
intensively studied. Henry Molaison underwent a bilateral removal of the medial com-
ponents of the temporal lobes, including the hippocampus, in an attempt to treat non-
responsive, severe epilepsy. After the surgery, he reported that his conscious state was
abnormal.Hefelthewas"constantlywakingupfromadream"with"everythinglooking

wasstunnedanddistressedbytheagingofhisfaceinthefollowingdecades,leadingto

Other neurological signs
Epilepticattacks
Epilepticattacksarecausedbystormsofelectricalhyperactivityinthebrain.Themoststriking
form of epilepsy is a generalized seizure:The person becomes unconscious and suffers violent
tonic-clonic muscle spasms. This type of seizure was traditionally called grand mal epilepsy.
In other forms of epilepsy, the episode appears as an 'absence,' a short period during which the
person appears to have lost touch with their surroundings and stares blankly ahead. These ab-
senceseizures wereformerlycalled petitmal seizures.
Epileptic attacks can be triggered by various things besides the "classical disease epilepsy."
Importanttriggersaredrugsandmedication,fever,tumors,electrolytedisorders,hypoglycemia
(alsoduetoinsulinoverdose),sleepdeprivation,orextremestress situations.
Sleepdisorders
Sleep is essential for all vertebrates. While we often think of sleep as a way to rebuild energy,
the body, and the brain continue to use energy while we are asleep. Very deep sleep may be a
5

way to conserve resources when intelligent behavior is not required, such as hibernating over
thewinterofsomeanimals.
Inhumans,sleeprunsin90-minutecycles.Ineachiteration,theproportionofslow-waveactiv-
ity in the electroencephalograph gradually becomes greater, eventually reaching widespread
slow-waveactivitycharacteristicofdeepsleep.Theendofonecycleisfollowedbyshortperi-
odsinwhichbrainactivityresemblesanawakestate,calledrapideyemovement(REM)sleep.
Subjects who were woken from various stages of sleep reported most often that dreams occur
during REM periods. On the other hand, the mental states of deep sleep are vague and not
dream-like. In addition to marked changes in the brain's electrical activity, the activity of vari-
ous neurotransmitter systems changes from deep sleep to REM sleep. REM sleep is character-
ized by high levels of cortical acetylcholine (ACh), reflecting a high level of activity and
arousal. During slow-wave sleep,ACh levels are much lower, and activation of the hippocam-
palinthis stateis associatedwiththeconsolidationof experienceintolong-termmemory.
Sleepregulation
Theregulationofsleepdependsonthefunctionofasmallnumberofspecificcellgroups
inthehindbrain,hypothalamus,andpreopticarea.Certainareasinthebrainstemand
hypothalamus have widespread projections to the cerebral cortex responsible for keep-
ing us awake and alert. These 'awake' centers are the locus coeruleus, the serotonin
raphe system, the dorsal tegmental nuclei, and the tuberomammillary nucleus of the
hypothalamus. An unusual feature of these nuclei is that each one relies on a specific
transmitter substance not found in the other members of this group. In the case of the
locus coeruleus, this is noradrenaline; in the raphe, it is serotonin; in the tegmental
nuclei, it is acetylcholine; and in the tuberomammillary nucleus, it is histamine. Sleep
occurs whenactivityinthesecenters is shutdown.
In the 1990s, the Saper group at Harvard began an ambitious project to unravel the
pathways that create sleep and awake states. By tracing the input connections of the
known awake centers, they discovered that a master sleep switch lies rostral to the hy-
pothalamus in the preoptic area. The sleep switch is a small cell group called the ven-
trolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO). The VLPO makes inhibitory connections with all
the'awake'centers(locuscoeruleus,raphenuclei,thecholinergictegmentalnuclei,and
thehistaminenucleusofthehypothalamus).WhentheVLPOisactivated,itswitchesoff
theawakecenters,andthecerebralcortexgoestosleep.DamagetotheVLPOcanpro-
duce pathological insomnia, a permanent inability to sleep. The activity of VLPO is
principally controlled by input from the visual pathway - fibers in the optic nerve con-
nect to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which is the 24-hour clock in the brain. This nu-
cleustellstheVLPOwhenitisdark,andthereforeagoodtimetogotosleep,andwhen
itis lightand timetowakeup.
A critical component of the sleep circuitry is the loop that stabilizes the system. If the
brain had only reciprocally interconnected centers for sleep and alertness, there might
be a tendency for behavior to flip unpredictably between sleeping and waking, as hap-
pensinnarcolepsy.Topreventthis,thedorsomedialnucleusofthehypothalamushasa

used to reach the CSF in the subarachnoid space in the vertebral canal between the fourth and
fifthlumbarvertebrae.Becausethespinalcordextendsnolowerthanthesecondlumbarverte-

The characteristic symptoms of meningitis are headache and neck stiffness in the presence of
fever. The most important diagnostic test is a lumbar puncture, which can reveal an elevated
white cell count and the presence of protein in the cerebrospinal fluid. Bacterial or viral infec-
tions usually trigger the diseases, less frequently by fungal, parasitic, or other infections. Bac-
terial meningitis can be effectively treated with antibiotics. Bacterial meningitis caused by
Haemophilus influenzae type B (HIB), Pneumococcus, and some forms of Meningococcus can

PrionDiseases
Creutzfeld-Jacobdisease(CJD)
CJD is caused by so-called prions (for proteinaceous infectious agents) – the presence of an
abnormal variant of the normal prion protein. Prions are misfolded proteins with an increased
β-sheet structure. They can force healthy proteins into a conformational change. The normal
prion protein (PrPc) is physiologically a membrane-tethered protein, mainly expressed in lym-
phocytes and neurons.The misfolded proteins (PrPsc) cannot be degraded by the body and ac-
cumulate into plaques. These aggregates disrupt the neuronal functions and cause rapidly pro-
gressivedementia,whichleads todeathusuallywithinoneyearfromtheonsetofthedisease.
TheprionCJD occurs spontaneouslyinoneineverymillionpeopleworldwide.

Rabies
Rabiesiscausedbyaneponymousviruspresentinthesalivaofinfectedbatsanddogsandcan
be transmitted by bites or scratches from these animals. The virus enters neuromuscular
synapses (like poliovirus) and then uses retrograde axonal transport to get to the motor neuron
cell bodies in the spinal cord. The remarkable feature of the rabies virus is that it can cross
synapses to reach all the neurons that connect with the infected neuron. In this way, the virus
can slowly spread to virtually all the cells in the spinal cord and brain. Eventually, sometimes
years after the initial infection, the cells degenerate, and death inevitably follows.This terrible
processcanbeinterruptedifaparticularvaccinationisadministeredwithinafewdaysoftrans-
missionfromabiteorscratchfromarabidanimal.
In untreated cases, the first symptoms are usually headaches, depressive moods, fever, and ex-
haustion. Later, this escalates into confusion, hallucinations, aggressive behavior, and muscle
spasms.Thediseaseisalmostalwaysfatalwithinseventotendaysaftertheonsetofneurolog-
ical symptoms. Diagnosis is made based on a history of an animal and, if necessary, neck skin
biopsy.
Neuroscience research uses the ability of the rabies virus to cross synapses for nerve tracing
techniques. Neural circuits can be retrogradely mapped using a pseudorabies virus, a non-dan-
gerous relativeoftheoriginalrabies virus.

Multiplesclerosis (MS)
Multiple sclerosis is a central nervous system disease with inflammatory (autoimmune) and
neurodegenerative components. The disease causes focal central nervous system lesions char-
acterized by demyelination of nerve fibers and axonal damage. MS is a relatively common
cause of neurological disability, especially in young adults, affecting women up to three times
morethanmen.Thecauseofthediseaseiscurrentlyunknown.However,recentstudiesprovide
strongevidencethatMS mayberelatedtoaprevious infectionwithEpstein-Barrvirus.
MS is associated with dysregulation of the patient's immune. This leads to a mistaken
activation of T lymphocytes which then attack oligodendrocytes and the production of
antibodies against myelin by recruited B cells. Both mechanisms destroy the myelin
sheaths within the white matter (demyelination), ultimately causing neuronal cell
death.
Since MS is a disease that usually progresses in relapses, the affected brain areas can
partiallyregenerateandrebuildthemyelinsheaths(remyelination)butnottheneurons
between two attacks. Insufficient regeneration leads to the formation of astrocyte scars
around the axons. These lesions are called plagues and are the characteristic signs of
MS,eventuallyleadingtothenameofMSsincetheGreekwordfor"plaque"isskleros.
The symptoms of multiple sclerosis characteristically follow a relapsing pattern, in which
episodesofdamageareseparatedbymonthswithoutnewsymptoms.Overtimetheepisodesof
damage become more frequent, and there is an overall gradual decline in the person's health.
Symptoms vary from person to person, depending on the location of the lesions. However, a
common first episode involves damage to one optic nerve resulting in blurred vision or blind-
ness.Latersymptomsmayincludefatigue,muscleweakness,lackofcoordination,sensoryab-
normalities,intentiontremor,andparalysis.
When axons become demyelinated, saltatory conduction is no longer possible. Conse-
quently, action potentials must be generated more frequently, and excitations can
spreadunspecificallyinthetissue.Theformerresultsinasignificantlyincreasedenergy
demand, explaining the general fatigue of many patients. The unspecific excitations
combined with the sheathed nerve cells' destruction can lead to general coordination
andperceptiondisorders.

toprogressivebrainatrophy,disproportionatelygreaterthanage-relatedphysiologicalcerebral
loss.
Individuals with dementia suffer progressive impairment in memory, thinking, and planning,
making it difficult to carry out everyday activities. There may also be emotional problems,
speech problems, and lack of motivation. The most common early symptom of dementia is
short-termmemoryloss,suchas theinabilitytorecallaparticularword.
The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease, accounting for about 65% of
cases.Thesecondmostcommoncauseis chronicvasculardisease.
Alzheimer's disease(AD)
Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent cause of dementia worldwide. It is associated with a
progressiveandrelentlesslossofnervecellsintheforebrain.WhileADismuchmorecommon
in older individuals, dementia is not a normal aging process. The earliest symptoms may be
minor episodes of memory loss. However, as the disease advances, the cognitive decline be-
comes overwhelming, eventually making it impossible for the patients to take care of them-
selves.

poralandparietallobeatrophy.
HistologicallyAD is characterized by the aggregation of specific proteins. Due to a defective
AP-protein (APP) degradation, amyloid-beta plaques accumulate extracellularly.Additionally,
hyperphosphorylated tau proteins accumulate intracellularly to form so-called neurofibrillary
tangles.
Both of these protein deposits lead to a disturbance of normal cell functions, resulting in cell
death.
Patients commonlydieofinfections suchas pneumoniawithinfouryears afterAD diagnosis.

Alzheimer's disease is usually diagnosed using neuropsychological tests like the mini-mental
state examination or other test batteries.Aloss of cortical brain tissue can be observed in CT
and MRI images. Examination of CSF from lumbar puncture may reveal an increase in phos-
pho-tau(releasedbycelldeath)andadecreaseinamyloid-beta(duetoaggregation)content.
Despite intensive research on the underlying causation ofAD, therapeutical options are mini-
mal. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are often prescribed to improve symptoms related to the
degeneration of cholinergic neurons. This helps that even small amounts of neurotransmitters
canstillhaveaneffect.
Parkinsonismsyndromes
Parkinsonism refers to a group of motor system diseases in which the cardinal symptoms are
tremor,rigor,akinesia,andposturalinstabilitydueto alackofdopamine.

Parkinson's disease(PD)
Parkinson'sdisease(PD)isamotorsystemdiseasethatmainlyoccursinolderadults,affecting
about1%ofindividualsolderthan60.AlthoughtheunderlyingcauseofPDisunknowninthe

To counteract these effects, L-DOPAcan be used in combination with inhibitors of dopamine-
degradingenzymes anddopamineagonists.
In drug-resistant or younger patients, deep brain stimulation has been used to control
symptoms. In deep brain stimulation, electrodes are implanted to stimulate certain
brain areas continuously. Up until about 2005, the main target for electrode placement
was the subthalamic nucleus which lies between the thalamus and hypothalamus, but

Epilepsy
Epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder characterized by repeated epileptic seizures - convulsions
or fits. Physiologically, the cerebral cortex maintains a close balance between excitation and
inhibition.Whenthisbalancefails,itcanresultinhyperexcitation,causingepilepsy.Oneover-
reactive region can stimulate others and cause storms of electrical activity to spread over the
wholecerebralcortex.Sincetheregulatorymechanismsforbalancingexcitationandinhibition
arecomplex,thecausesofepilepsyarechallengingtodiscerninmanycases.Insomecases,an
evident focal cause, such as a tumor or injury, can be detected and treated with surgery. How-
ever, in most cases, people with epilepsy are treated with a combination of drugs that alter the
actions ofexcitatoryorinhibitoryneurotransmitters.
Unfortunately, these medications affect the entire cortex, so side effects are very common and
usually very frustrating. Often a long search has to be done to find a treatment balancing the
maximumbenefits withminimalsideeffects.

Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a particular form of epilepsy characterized by abnor-
mal behavior. TLE can be triggered by scarring from damage to the medial side of the
temporal lobe. These injuries can occur during a difficult birth when pressure on the
cerebrum pushes the tip of the temporal lobe against a ridge of dura mater and causes
loss of blood supply and damage. Later in life, these areas of scar tissue may trigger
electrical disturbances, which spread through the temporal lobe. Because aggressive
behavior is sometimes a symptom of TLE attacks, many of the sufferers were sent to
prisonorpsychiatrichospitalsinthepast.Duringthe1960s,itwasrecognizedthatthis
syndrome was simply a form of epilepsy, which can be successfully treated with anti-
epileptic drugs. TLE mainly affects structures on the medial side of the temporal lobe,
including the hippocampus, uncus, and the amygdala. The study of patients with TLE
may give us clues about the functions of these complex areas within the temporal lobe.
For example, patients frequently experience abnormal smell sensations when having a

Trauma
Spinalcorddamage
Spinal cord damage is most commonly caused by trauma (car accidents or falls). Nonetheless,
itcanalsoresultfrominfections,insufficientbloodflow,ortumors.
In the acute phase after severe injury, there may be a complete loss of all functions related to
theaffectedarea.This is calledspinalshock.

Genetic Conditions
Downsyndrome
Trisomy 21, also known as Down syndrome, is the most common chromosomal disorder in
newborns (about two-thirds of all cases) and the most common cause of mental retardation in
children.Inthis disorder,parts ofor theentirechromosome21arepresentinathirdcopy.
The disease is associated with characteristic facial features, a delay in cognitive ability, and
physical growth. As adults, subjects with trisomy 21 usually have the abilities of an 8-9 year
old child. Besides intellectual disabilities,Trisomie 21 carries an increased risk of other disor-
ders likeacongenitalheartdefectorepilepsy.

FragileX syndrome
Fragile X syndrome, sometimes called Martin-Bell syndrome, is the most common mono-
geneticcauseofintellectualdisabilityandthesecondmostcommoncauseofcongenitalmental
retardation after trisomy 21. It is estimated to underlie at least 6% of all with intellectual dis-
abilities.
It is a genetic disorder typically due to a higher number of repetitions of a CGG-triplet
withinthefragileXmentalretardation1(FMR1)gene(trinucleotiderepeatexpansion).

Rettsyndrome
Rettsyndromeis oneofthemostcommongeneticcauses ofmentalretardationingirls.
It is an X-chromosomal dominant disease that affects females almost exclusively. Males with
theconditioneitherdiebeforebirthordonotlivelongerthantwoyears.
The Rett syndrome is strongly associated with various mutations in the MECP2 gene
found on the X chromosome. The physiological gene product binds to methylated DNA
andisinvolvedinregulatingthousandsofgenes.Theexactmoleculareffectsdependon
the specific mutation but usually include changes in synaptic plasticity, neurotransmit-
ter imbalances,andcorticalhyperexcitability.
The infant is commonly normal at birth but develops symptoms between 6 and 18 months of
age. Cognitive skills, especially speaking or walking, begin to stagnate or regress. Patients of-
ten have small hands and feet, deceleration of the rate of head growth, and repetitive, stereo-
typed hand movements. Many patients have seizures, have no verbal skills, and cannot walk.
Scoliosis and constipation are prevalent. Despite severe disabilities, affected women can live
upto40years ofage.

The mutated gene product has a toxic effect leading to brain atrophy, particularly affecting
Gaba-ergic nerve cells in the basal ganglia; above all, medium-spiny neurons in the corpus
striatumaredamaged.
Symptomsusuallyappearbetweentheagesof35and50,correlatinginverselywiththenumber

Duchennemusculardystrophy(DMD)
Duchenne type muscular dystrophy is the most common disease in the group of progressive
musculardystrophies,characterizedbyprimarymusclefiberdegeneration.Musclecelldeathin
DMD is caused by a gene defect on the X chromosome in the dystrophin gene, making the
muscles vulnerable to oxidative and mechanical stress. The degenerated muscle fibers are
sometimes replaced by adipose or connective tissue so that swelling occurs, and the muscle
atrophyis notobvious.This process is calledpseudohypertrophy.
The typical onset is between the first and the fifth year of life, leading to a rapid paresis and
muscleatrophybeginningfromthepelvicgirdle,progressingtotheshoulders.Untiltheageof

Diseases of the peripheral nervous system
25

Myastheniagravis
Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease in which mistakenly produced antibodies block
and destroy postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). This disrupts the neuromuscular
transmissionatthemotorendplate,resultinginexercise-dependentmuscleweakness.Themus-
cleweaknessworsenswithactivityandimproveswithrest.Inmostcases,myastheniagravisis
associated with a pathological change in the thymus. The thymus is an organ of the immune
system where T cells mature. The changes there probably lead to the development of T helper
cells againstthenAChRs,whichcaninitiateantibodyproductioninBcells.
The eye, face, and swallowing apparatus muscles are most commonly affected. Double vision,
droopingeyelids,speech,andwalkingproblems mayoccur.
EMG fatiguetests canbeusedtoconfirmthediagnosis.
Treatment is based on the use of immunosuppressants and cholinesterase inhibitors, and
thymectomy (removal of the thymus) is sometimes effective. Spontaneous remissions some-
times occur.
Peripheralneuropathy

(e.g., toxic, infectious, or metabolic factors). Symptoms often include pain, sensory loss, pare-
sis, and autonomic dysfunction, as motor, sensory and autonomic nerves can be affected. The
disease usually affects the longest nerves first, so the most common initial sign is numbness in
thetoes.
In Europe, diabetes mellitus (diabetic neuropathy) and alcohol dependence are the most com-
moncauses;intropicalandsubtropicalregions,itis malnutritionandleprosy.
In addition to good medical history, EMG can be used for diagnostics. Therapeutically, the

Non-genetic developmental disorders
Certaindevelopmentalinsultscancausedevastatingdamagetothedevelopingbrainandspinal
cord. These include vitamin deficiency (neural tube defect), alcohol (fetal alcohol syndrome),
iodine deficiency, and infections (rubella). Each one of these can cause widespread damage to
the fetal brain. It is possible that viral infections may also cause cerebral palsy during preg-
nancy.
Neuraltubedefect(NTD)
Neural tube defects are the most common malformations of the brain and spinal cord. Neural
tube defect results from a disruption of the very early development of the neural tube, with
incomplete closure at the rostral and caudal ends. The most common result of an incomplete
closure is seen in the caudal part of the spinal cord, where it is called spina bifida. Depending
onhow severetheclosuredefectis,onedistinguishes betweendifferentforms (seefigure).
Usually,thedamagetothespinalcordresultsinparalysisofthelowerlimbandlossofcontrol
of the bladder and bowel. Cases affecting the rostral neural tube can result in malformation of
thebrainventricles,resultinginhydrocephalus.
SomefamilieshaveageneticpredispositiontoNTD.However,themostcriticalfactorhasbeen
shown to be a lack of vitamin folate. For this reason, all women who might possibly become
pregnantshouldmakesurethattheirfolateintakeishigh–eitherbyeatingleafyvegetablesand
other folate-rich foods or by taking folate vitamin tablets as a supplement. In many countries,
bread flour and breakfast cereals are enriched with folate to ensure that the whole population
has adequatefolatelevels.

remedied with the supply of iodine supplements in salt and oil, but this is not always easy to
achievebecauseoflogisticimpediments.
Infantilecerebralpalsy(CP)
Infantile cerebral palsy refers to a group of movement disorders in early childhood. The main
cause appears to be damage to the striatum and pallidum ('basal ganglia') in the last three
months of pregnancy, possibly from an infectious agent. Because the cerebral cortex develops
afterbirth,itusuallyescapes damageincerebralpalsy cases.
Foursubtypes ofCParedistinguished:

Psychiatric disorders and disorders of behavior
Many neurological diseases are reasonably well understood in terms of the specific brain re-
gions that are affected. However, in the case of mental illness, the situation is much less clear.
While the treatment of mental illness has improved a great deal in the past 50 years, there has
not been much progress in understanding the underlying pathological changes that cause these
conditions.Mentalillness affects aboutone-thirdofallpeopleatsomepointintheirlife.
Attentiondeficithyperactivitydisorder(ADHD)
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder character-

Thesesymptomsmustoccuroveratleastsixmonthsandhavetobeobservedindifferentenvi-
ronments (typicallyschoolandhome)for adiagnosis.
While the condition is usually diagnosed in children, it can persist into adult life. There are
considerablymoreboysthangirlsaffected.TheincidenceofADHDinchildrenisestimatedto
be around 5% worldwide. For many years there has been controversy about the diagnosis and
treatment ofADHD. However, there is now an international consensus that stimulant medica-
tion (methylphenidate) effectively reduces symptoms and makes it possible for the individual
toliveanormallife.
Autismspectrumdisorder(ASD)
The term autism spectrum disorder refers to a range of developmental conditions, including
problems with social communication and unusual repetitive behavior.Although autism is one
of the best-known child psychiatric terms, the disorder is rare overall. Classical (early-child-
hood) Autism or Asperger syndrome are examples of this group of diseases. The symptoms
differ depending on which subtype the patient is affected by.As a rule, however, these are ac-
companied by disturbed social behavior and an inability to empathize. The classic variant is
usually accompanied by cognitive impairment, butAsperger's syndrome is not necessarily. In-
sulargifts,asseeninfilms,areextremelyrareandasubtypeofAsperger'ssyndrome.Thecause
is stillunknown.Severalgenes areassociatedwithanincreasedriskofthedisease.

Affectivedisorders
Affective disorders are a group of psychological disorders, all featuring a clinically significant
changeinmood.Theycanbedividedaccordingtotheirso-calledpolarityandthetimecourse.
The polarity indicates the direction in which the mood change takes effect. Examples are de-
pression(pathologicaldeclineinthemood)ormania(pathologicalincreaseinthemood).Ifthe
change is only in one direction, it is called a unipolar disorder. If the mood is sometimes ele-
vated and sometimes depressed, we speak of a bipolar disorder. The most common affective
disorder is unipolar depression, i.e., a disorder characterized by a depressed mood without
phases ofeuphoriaorsimilar.
Unipolar depression
Depression is a state of low mood and lack of interest in everyday activity. Symptoms may
include changes in appetite or sleep patterns, loss of energy, decreased libido, irritability, feel-
ings ofworthlessness,andthoughts ofsuicide.
There is no single cause of depression, but it is associated with many factors, including family
history, trauma, and stress. Neurotransmitter imbalance is thought to underly many cases of
depression. Despite numerous studies, the exact neurotransmitters involved in depression are
stillunknown.Currentpharmacologicaltreatmentprimarilyaimstoincreasetheactivityofthe
neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain.This is achieved either by decreasing uptake (selective
serotoninreuptakeinhibitors–SSRIs)orincreasingproduction.Severaldifferentdrugsarecur-
rently prescribed, with varying efficacies and side-effect profiles. The real value of pharmaco-
logical treatment in cases of mild-to-moderate depression has been questioned, and there is a
greatdealofcurrentinterestintheuseof cognitive-behavioraltherapy.
Significant depression affects a third of the population at some point in their lifetime. The
episodes generally begin in early adulthood. Women are recorded as being more commonly
affected,butthis mayjustrepresentagreaterwillingness offemales toseekhelp.
Thediagnosisismainlyduetotheclinicalpresentation.SometimesahigherrateofREMsleep
canbeobserved.
Bipolar affectivedisorder
Bipolar affective disorder is defined by the presence of one or more major episodes of abnor-
mallyelevatedmood.Theseelevatedstatesareclinicallyreferredtoasmania.Itiscommonfor
individuals who experience manic episodes to experience depressive episodes as well, hence
the name 'manic depression. Because of these changes in both directions of mood distortions,
it is called a bipolar affective disorder. The cause is still unknown, but there is a tendency for
cases toclusterinfamilies.
Somepharmacologicalandpsychotherapeutictechniqueshavebeenappliedtotreatbipolaraf-
fective disorders. However, the mainstays of treatment are mood stabilizers such as lithium
chloride(whichaffectsintracellularcalciumhandling)orsodiumvalproate(whichaffectsneu-
rotransmission).
It is crucial to distinguish between depression and bipolar disorder carefully. Medications for
(unipolar) depression can quickly move a misdiagnosed bipolar disorder from the depressive
phasetoaverystrongmanicphase.

There has been a great deal of research into the particular brain regions and neurotransmitters
involved in the disease, but we still do not have a clear picture of the underlying pathology.
However, drug treatment is moderately effective in many cases. Some of these drugs work by
influencingthelevelofneurotransmitters suchas serotoninanddopamine.

Substanceabuse
Substance abuse can be defined as the abnormal use of a substance that leads to impairment of
thephysical,social,oroccupationalaspectsofone'slife.Substanceabuseoftenleadstodepen-
dence or tolerance. Dependence is the physical need to use a drug to maintain the effects pro-
voked by its intake. Dependent users experience withdrawal symptoms when they are unable
to maintain consumption of the drug.Addicted users crave the drug even if they know it dam-
agestheirwork,health,andfamily.Drugsathigherriskofdependencearecocaine,heroin,and
nicotine; drugs with lower risk are alcohol, cannabis, ecstasy, and amphetamine. During the
development of dependence, the body and brain slowly adapt to the repeated presence of the
drug,thelackofwhichthencauses unpleasantfeelings.
Tolerance to a drug is experienced when a specific dose, taken previously to generate a certain
physicalstate,isnolongereffective,andhigherdosesarerequired.Withregularuse,tolerance
may develop. Higher doses or more frequent use are needed to produce the same level of plea-
sureandrelieffromwithdrawal.

content of alcohol, severe alcoholics do not need much more food to reach their daily caloric
needsandthusfailtomeettheirvitaminneeds.Theabsenceofthiamineinterruptscarbohydrate
